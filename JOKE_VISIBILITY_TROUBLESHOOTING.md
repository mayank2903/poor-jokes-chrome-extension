## **🔧 Solutions (Try in Order)**

### **Solution 1: Force Clear Cache**
1. **Open Chrome** and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. **Find** your "Joor Pokes" extension
3. **Click "Reload"** (🔄) to refresh the extension
4. **Open a new tab** and check console logs

### **Solution 2: Manual Cache Clear**
1. **Open Developer Tools** (F12) in the new tab
2. **Go to Console** tab
3. **Run this command**:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem('poorJokes_cache');
   localStorage.removeItem('poorJokes_lastFetch');
   localStorage.removeItem('poorJokes_displayHistory');
   location.reload();
   ```

### **Solution 3: Use Refresh Button**
1. **Open new tab** with the extension
2. **Click the refresh button** (🔄) in the extension
3. **Wait 5-10 seconds** for fresh jokes to load
4. **Open several new tabs** to increase chances

### **Solution 4: Check Console Debug Logs**
1. **Open Developer Tools** (F12)
2. **Go to Console** tab
3. **Look for these messages**:
   ```
   🌐 Fetching fresh jokes from API...
   ✅ Loaded fresh jokes from API: 54
   🎯 Your joke is loaded: "You look great today!" (ID: 23e5e6ea...)
   ```
4. **If you see "❌ Your joke is NOT in the loaded jokes"** - the cache is stale

---

## **🐛 Root Cause Analysis**

### **The Problem**
The extension uses **hybrid caching**:
- **Cache Duration**: 1 hour (now reduced to 5 minutes)
- **Max Cache Age**: 24 hours (now reduced to 30 minutes)
- **Your joke**: Was approved after the last cache refresh

### **Why This Happens**
1. **Extension loads** with cached jokes (old data)
2. **Background refresh** only happens every hour
3. **Your joke** was approved between cache refreshes
4. **Even tab refresh** doesn't force API call if cache is valid

---

## **📊 Debug Information**

### **Check if Your Joke is Loaded**
In the browser console, look for:
```javascript
// This should show your joke
allJokes.find(joke => joke.content.includes('You look great today'))
```

### **Check Cache Status**
```javascript
// Check if cache exists
localStorage.getItem('poorJokes_cache')

// Check last fetch time
localStorage.getItem('poorJokes_lastFetch')
```

### **Force Fresh Load**
```javascript
// Clear all caches and reload
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

---

## **🎯 Updated Extension Features**

### **Cache Improvements**
- **Refresh Interval**: Reduced from 1 hour to 5 minutes
- **Max Cache Age**: Reduced from 24 hours to 30 minutes
- **Debug Logging**: Added detailed joke selection logs

### **Debug Messages**
The extension now logs:
- ✅ When your joke is loaded
- ❌ When your joke is missing
- 📊 Joke selection statistics
- 🔄 Cache refresh status

## **🚀 Quick Fix Commands**
